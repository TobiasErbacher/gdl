# Cooperative Graph Neural Networks

The contents in this folder are adapted from the [github repository](https://github.com/benfinkelshtein/CoGNN/tree/main) of [Finkelshtein et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2310.01267).

To reproduce the results we have to use Python 3.9, PyTorch version 2.0.0, Cuda 11.8, PyG version 2.3.0, and torchmetrics.

The datasets that we will be training on are already downloaded in [another folder](https://github.com/TobiasErbacher/gdl/tree/main/replication/data).

Further installation instructions can be found in the [original github repository](https://github.com/benfinkelshtein/CoGNN/tree/main).

The main file of this approach is _main.ipynb_.
